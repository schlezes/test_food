Notice that dairy is highlighted in red and the banner above is also highlighte in red.

On load, this app is ready to produce a result.

At this point, a mouse click event will produce a result.

In this case, on a fresh start, a mouse click on dariy will produce a redbanner across the word dariy and will also prodeuce a red banner above with an explaination about the click result.

With dairy, the popular position among foood combination experts agree that a dairy product should always be consumed by itself and with nothing else.

At this point, the single click on the dairy returns the app to a non responsive further click event.

And, the is waiting for a click event on the start over button.

Going further, 

The click event on any food group inside one of the 12 squares will produce either a red banner, grenn banner or orange banner.

Green means okay. Red significes do not combine. Orange significes another food group for selection is available.

I have designed this app to allow for only two clicks on any food selection.

For example,

one click on fish will allow for a second click on low fat carbs.  The result in this case will be a green bannner significaing okay for the food combinations.

one click on seeds will produce and orange banner on the seeds and will allow for a second click for something else.

This is the first version of a food combining application using VUE as the design platform.  

At the time of this design, I was a member of the VUE Meetups Group in Los Angeles.  

As part my contribution with this group, I designed this application and presented-it at one of the meetup dates.

There were about 20 attendees that evening, from beginning VUE members to well seasoned software engineers.

And; yes, I accomplished my goal.

It seemed that everyone was interested in the subject matter as I received lots of questions about the material.

The more seasoned developers were anxious to view my source code and data base that described the food groups.

Therefore, something for everyone.

My vision at the front-end of this app was a possibly to migrate it to a phone whereby persons at a restaurant could decide if the choices of food combinations for the evening would not cause indigestion.

In reality, it would seem that the reason for a restaurant dining was for celebration and not for the critiquing the food choices for the evening.

After the presentation, I did not go any further with this app as there were other pressing matters to attend to.

Actually, this design was really good effort with the VUE platform.

This is the first version of a food combining application using VUE as the design platform.  

At the time of this design, I was a member of the VUE Meetups Group in Los Angeles.  

As part my contribution with this group, I designed this application and presented-it at one of the meetup dates.

There were about 20 attendees that evening, from beginning VUE members to well seasoned software engineers.

And; yes, I accomplished my goal.

It seemed that everyone was interested in the subject matter as I received lots of questions about the material.

The more seasoned developers were anxious to view my source code and data base that described the food groups.

Therefore, something for everyone.

My vision at the front-end of this app was a possibly to migrate it to a phone whereby persons at a restaurant could decide if the choices of food combinations for the evening would not cause indigestion.

In reality, it would seem that the reason for a restaurant dining was for celebration and not for the critiquing the food choices for the evening.

After the presentation, I did not go any further with this app as there were other pressing matters to attend to.

Actually, this design was really good effort with the VUE platform.

Thanks,

Vince Schlezes
